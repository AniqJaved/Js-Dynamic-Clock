 # So basically we are using the setinterval which is used to call the function defined inside it after time given at second parameter. 
        var clock = setInterval(clocktiming,1000)
       
        function clocktiming(){
            var d = new Date;
	# Here we are only extracting the time from the whole Data object.
            var time = d.toLocaleTimeString();
	# Here we are writing that time to the paragraph with id showClock
            document.getElementById('showClock').innerHTML = time;
